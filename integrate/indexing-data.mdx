## Data model
Each document has an `id` and `text` (plus optional metadata).

```ts
import { MossClient } from '@inferedge/moss'
const client = new MossClient(process.env.MOSS_PROJECT_ID!, process.env.MOSS_PROJECT_KEY!)
await client.createIndex('my-index', [
  { id: 'doc-1', text: '...' },
  { id: 'doc-2', text: '...' }
], 'moss-minilm')
```

## Chunking tips
- Aim for ~200–500 tokens per chunk
- Overlap 10–20% to preserve context
- Normalize whitespace and strip boilerplate

## Monitoring
- Track upsert counts and latency
- Rebuild index after major schema changes
