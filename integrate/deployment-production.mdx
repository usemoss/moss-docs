## Checklist
- Configure API keys via env vars
- Persist indexes to a durable path
- Monitor index size and query latency
- Enable sync (optional) and test offline mode
- Add health checks for embedding/runtime services

## Security
- Keep data local whenever possible
- Encrypt synced data at rest/in transit

## Observability
- Track query latency (p50/p95) and index size growth
- Log index lifecycle events (create/load/delete, rebuilds)
- Establish backup/export cadence for disaster recovery
