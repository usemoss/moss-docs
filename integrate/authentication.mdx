For SDK access, set your Moss project credentials. Choose shell exports or a `.env` file.

```bash
export MOSS_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
export MOSS_PROJECT_KEY=your_project_key
```

Or `.env`:

```bash
echo "MOSS_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id" >> .env
echo "MOSS_PROJECT_KEY=your_project_key" >> .env
```

<CodeGroup>
```ts JavaScript
import { MossClient } from '@inferedge/moss'
const client = new MossClient(process.env.MOSS_PROJECT_ID!, process.env.MOSS_PROJECT_KEY!)
```

```python Python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from inferedge_moss import MossClient

load_dotenv()  # optional, if using a .env file
client = MossClient(os.getenv('MOSS_PROJECT_ID'), os.getenv('MOSS_PROJECT_KEY'))
```
