# Documentation Maintenance Guide

This guide lives alongside the published site so contributors can regenerate the API reference without exposing internal steps to end users.

## Auto-generated content

The following files are completely generated by tooling and should not be edited manually:

| Path | Source | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/reference/js/**/*` | `javascript/user-facing-sdk/typedoc.json` | `npm run docs` (inside `javascript/user-facing-sdk/`) |
| `docs/reference/python/**/*` | `python/user-facing-sdk/src/inferedge_moss/__init__.pyi` | `python scripts/generate_docs.py` (inside `python/user-facing-sdk/`) |

When these commands run, the contents of those paths are overwritten. Commit the regenerated files after confirming they build.

## Manually maintained content

- `docs/index.md`
- `docs/getting-started.md`
- Navigation and sidebar settings in `.vitepress/config.mts`

Update these pages directly to evolve copy, examples, and site structure.

## Regeneration workflow

1. **JavaScript TypeDoc**

   ```bash
   cd javascript/user-facing-sdk
   npm install
   npm run docs
   ```

   Output lands in `documentation/docs/reference/js/`. (includes `README.md`, `globals.md`, and subfolders)

2. **Python Griffe-based generator**

   ```bash
   cd python/user-facing-sdk
   source moss-env/bin/activate  # or your virtualenv
   pip install -e ".[dev]"  # Ensures griffe is installed
   python scripts/generate_docs.py
   ```

   Output lands in `documentation/docs/reference/python/` (includes `globals.md`, `classes/`, `interfaces/`, and `type-aliases/` subdirectories).

3. **Build the site**

   ```bash
   cd documentation
   npm install
   npm run docs:build
   ```

   Fix any dead-link warnings before committing.

## Tips

- Keep the generated references in sync with SDK releases by running the commands above whenever public APIs change.
- If the output paths need to change, update the configs listed in the table and reflect the new locations here.
- To preview changes locally, run `npm run docs:dev` from the `documentation/` folder.
