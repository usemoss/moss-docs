# Type Alias: MossModel

> **MossModel** = `"moss-minilm"` \| `"moss-mediumlm"`

Available embedding models for text-to-vector conversion.

Each model offers different trade-offs between speed, accuracy, and resource usage:

- **moss-minilm**: Lightweight model optimized for speed and efficiency.
  Best for applications requiring fast response times with moderate accuracy requirements.

- **moss-mediumlm**: Balanced model offering higher accuracy with reasonable performance.
  Best for applications where search quality is important and moderate latency is acceptable.
