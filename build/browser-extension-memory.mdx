## Problem
Extensions need to remember context and work with limited APIs.

## Architecture
- Background service worker hosts a Moss client
- Content scripts post messages to background for index/query
- Persist index using extension storage or IndexedDB

## Code walkthrough (Background)

```ts
// background.ts
import { MossClient } from '@inferedge/moss'
const client = new MossClient(process.env.MOSS_PROJECT_ID!, process.env.MOSS_PROJECT_KEY!)

chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(async (msg, _sender, sendResponse) => {
  if (msg.type === 'query') {
    await client.loadIndex('ext-knowledge')
    const res = await client.query('ext-knowledge', msg.text, 3)
    sendResponse(res)
  }
})
```

## Outcome
Lightweight, private knowledge that improves responses and suggestions.
