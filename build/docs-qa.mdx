## Problem
Users need precise answers from large documentation sets.

## Architecture
- Chunk docs -> embed -> index
- Query: retrieve top-k -> rerank -> answer

## Code walkthrough (JavaScript)

```ts
import { MossClient } from '@inferedge/moss'
const client = new MossClient(process.env.MOSS_PROJECT_ID!, process.env.MOSS_PROJECT_KEY!)

await client.createIndex('docs-qa', chunks, 'moss-minilm')
await client.loadIndex('docs-qa')
const results = await client.query('docs-qa', 'reset password limits', 5)
```

## Outcome
Accurate, fast answers in-product without leaving the page.
