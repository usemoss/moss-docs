title: "Agent Memory"
description: "Add long-term memory to AI agents with Moss"
---

## Problem
Agents forget context across sessions. We need durable memory.

## Architecture
- Store interactions as documents with embeddings
- Retrieve relevant memories per prompt
- Update memory store after each turn

## Code walkthrough

```ts
import { Moss } from '@moss-ai/sdk'
const moss = new Moss()

await moss.index.upsert([{ id: 'user_profile', text: 'User prefers concise answers.' }])
const memories = await moss.search.query('preferences for responses')
```

## Result
Agents recall user preferences and prior context reliably.
