---

Moss enables low-latency, offline-first semantic search and memory for AI applications.

- High-performance runtime for real-time semantic search (sub-10 ms lookups)
- Offline-first search with local indexes; zero infra overhead
- Private by default (process locally, sync when needed)
- Runs where your agent lives: cloud, browser, or on-device

## Where Moss shines

- Build offline-first search for desktop and mobile
- Add long-term memory to AI agents
- Run local embeddings without a cloud call
- Power docs/help-center Q&A with fast retrieval

## Using Moss Portal

- Sign up at Moss, confirm email, and sign in
- Choose a plan:
  - Free Tier ($0): 1 project, 3 indexes, 1,000 items/index, community support
  - Developer Workspace ($2000/month + usage): unlimited projects/indexes, 100 GB storage, 100 GB ingestion, 1 TB egress, priority support
- From the dashboard, click **Create Index** and copy your **Project ID** and **Project Key** for `.env`
- Join our Discord to get onboarded: [Moss Discord](https://discord.gg/eMXExuafBR)

## Samples

- View samples repo: [moss-samples on GitHub](https://github.com/usemoss/moss-samples)
- JavaScript: `javascript/comprehensive_sample.ts`, `javascript/load_and_query_sample.ts`
- Python: `python/comprehensive_sample.py`, `python/load_and_query_sample.py`
- Adapt by swapping the FAQ data with your own, or plug Moss calls into your app

## How it works (at a glance)

- Index: Convert your data into an efficient local index
- Embeddings: Generate semantic vectors locally or via a remote service
- Retrieval: Query with semantic similarity or hybrid approaches
- Storage: Persist indexes locally and optionally sync to cloud
