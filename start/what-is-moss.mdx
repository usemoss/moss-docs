Moss enables low-latency, offline-first semantic search and memory for AI applications.

- Offline-first search with local indexes
- Private by default (process locally, sync when needed)
- Sub-10ms query latency on commodity hardware

## Where Moss shines

- Build offline-first search for desktop and mobile
- Add long-term memory to AI agents
- Run local embeddings without a cloud call
- Power docs/help-center Q&A with fast retrieval

## How it works (at a glance)

- Index: Convert your data into an efficient local index
- Embeddings: Generate semantic vectors locally or via a remote service
- Retrieval: Query with semantic similarity or hybrid approaches
- Storage: Persist indexes locally and optionally sync to cloud
