Moss is real-time semantic search for conversational AI. It delivers sub-10 ms lookups, instant index updates, and zero infra overhead. Moss runs where your agent lives—cloud, in-browser, or on-device—so search feels native and users never wait. You connect your data once; Moss handles indexing, packaging, distribution, and updates.

- Sub-10 ms lookups; instant index updates
- Zero infra overhead; local-first with optional sync
- Runs where your agent lives: cloud, browser, or on-device
- You connect data once; Moss handles distribution and updates

## Where Moss shines

- Build offline-first search for desktop and mobile
- Add agent knowledge without centralizing user data
- Run local embeddings without a cloud call
- Power docs/help-center Q&A with fast retrieval

## Using Moss Portal

- Sign up at Moss, confirm email, and sign in
- From the portal, click **Create Index** and copy your **Project ID** and **Project Key** for `.env`
- Join our Discord to get onboarded: [Moss Discord](https://discord.gg/eMXExuafBR)

## Samples

- View samples repo: [moss-samples on GitHub](https://github.com/usemoss/moss-samples)
- JavaScript: `javascript/comprehensive_sample.ts`, `javascript/load_and_query_sample.ts`
- Python: `python/comprehensive_sample.py`, `python/load_and_query_sample.py`
- Adapt by swapping the FAQ data with your own, or plug Moss calls into your app

## How it works (at a glance)

- Index: Convert your data into an efficient local index
- Embeddings: Generate semantic vectors locally or via a remote service
- Retrieval: Query with semantic similarity or hybrid approaches
- Storage: Persist indexes locally and optionally sync to cloud
