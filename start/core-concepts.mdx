This page defines the core concepts you’ll use across Moss.

## Index
Structure that powers fast, local search. You add documents, we build an efficient index for sub-10ms queries.

## Embeddings
Semantic vector representations of text. Can be generated locally or via a remote model, then stored alongside your index.

## Retrieval
How results are fetched. Options include vector similarity, keyword, and hybrid methods with scoring and reranking.

## Storage & Sync
Persist indexes locally (desktop/mobile). Optionally sync segments to the cloud for backup and sharing.

## Authentication
Used for optional cloud features like syncing or hosted embedding models. Local mode requires no network access.
