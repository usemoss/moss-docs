**Required fields**: `indexName`, `docIds` (non-empty array)

**Example request**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://service.usemoss.dev/v1/manage" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-service-version: v1" \
  -H "x-project-key: moss_access_key_xxxxx" \
  -d '{
    "action": "deleteDocs",
    "projectId": "project_123",
    "indexName": "support-faq",
