description: Control Plane endpoint structure and shared request schema.
mode: "wide"

All API actions are multiplexed through the `/v1/manage` endpoint. Provide an `action` string plus the required fields for that operation. On success, handlers return `2xx` JSON payloads outlined below. Failures return structured errors:

```json
{
  "error": "Human-readable message",
  "action": "addDocs" // present on server errors
}
```

Shared request schema:

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `action` | string | ✅ | One of `initUpload`, `startBuild`, `getJobStatus`, `getIndex`, `listIndexes`, `deleteIndex`, `addDocs`, `deleteDocs`, `getDocs`, `getIndexUrl`. |
| `projectId` | string | ✅ | Project identifier issued by Moss Control. |
| `indexName` | string | ▶︎ | Required for index-scoped actions. |

> **Required headers:** `x-project-key` with your project access key and `x-service-version: v1`.
