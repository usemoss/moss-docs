title: "What is Moss?"
description: "Real-time semantic search that runs where your agent lives"
---

Moss is the runtime for real-time semantic search in conversational apps. It delivers sub-10 ms lookups and instant index updates without extra infrastructure. It runs in the browser, on-device, or in the cloud - wherever your agent lives - so search feels native. Connect your data once; Moss packages, distributes, and keeps indexes fresh.

- Sub-10 ms lookups with instant updates
- No infra to run; local-first with optional sync
- Browser, device, or cloud - same API

## Where Moss shines

- Sub-10 ms answers for docs/FAQ/search
- Ground agents with your data without centralizing user info
- Local or hybrid embeddings; minimal infra

## Using Moss Portal

- Sign up at Moss, confirm email, and sign in
- From the portal, click **Create Index** and copy your **Project ID** and **Project Key** for your SDK
- Join our Discord to get onboarded: [Moss Discord](https://discord.gg/eMXExuafBR)

## Samples

- View samples repo: [moss-samples on GitHub](https://github.com/usemoss/moss-samples)
- JavaScript: `javascript/comprehensive_sample.ts`, `javascript/load_and_query_sample.ts`
- Python: `python/comprehensive_sample.py`, `python/load_and_query_sample.py`
- Adapt by swapping the FAQ data with your own, or plug Moss calls into your app

## How it works (at a glance)

- **Index:** Convert your data into an efficient local index
- **Embeddings:** Generate semantic vectors locally or via a remote service
- **Retrieval:** Query with semantic similarity or hybrid approaches
- **Storage:** Persist indexes locally and optionally sync to cloud
