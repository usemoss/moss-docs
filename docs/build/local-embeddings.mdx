## Why local
Keep data on-device and remove network as a bottleneck.

## Setup
Use a local model where supported, or pick a remote embedding in index creation.

```ts
import { MossClient } from '@inferedge/moss'
const client = new MossClient(process.env.MOSS_PROJECT_ID!, process.env.MOSS_PROJECT_KEY!)
await client.createIndex('local-embeddings', docs, 'moss-minilm')
```

## Tips
- Batch inputs for speed
- Cache vectors for unchanged content
- Use hybrid retrieval for best relevance
